    <p>1. How do you get help?
        I can go to the Lab and ask the tutors for help during their lab hours.

    <p>2. What time are engagement assignments due? Can you turn them in late? What if you miss one?
        engagement assignments are due at 11:59 PM on the due date. You can turn them in late, but if you miss one, your 4 lowest score will be dropped at the end of the term.

    <p>3. What time are projects due? Can you turn them in late? What if you miss one?
        projects are due at 11:59 PM on the due date. You can turn them in late with a late penalty. If you miss one without an approved extension, you will receive a 0 for that project.
