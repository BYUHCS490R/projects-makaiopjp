    <h2>Internet</h2>
    <p>The internet is a global network that connects computers that communicate with each other using cables to connect one another. It enables the sharing of information, resources, and services.</p>
    <h2>Web</h2>
    <p>The Web also known as the World Wide Web is a system of interlinked hyperlinks and multimedia content available on the internet.</p>
    <h2>How are the internet and Web different?</h2>
    <p>The internet is the part that connects computers globally, while the Web is the service that operates from the internet, allowing users to access and share information through websites.</p>
    <h2>ASCII and Unicode</h2>
    <p>ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a character encoding standard that uses 7 bits to represent characters, allowing for 128 unique symbols, including letters, numbers, and control characters. It is primarily used for English text.</p>
    <p>Unicode is a more comprehensive character encoding standard that uses up to 32 bits to represent characters, allowing for over a million unique symbols. It supports a wide range of characters from various languages and scripts, making it suitable for global communication.</p>
    <h2>What is UTF-8?</h2>
    <p>UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format - 8-bit) is a variable-length character encoding for Unicode that uses one to four bytes to represent characters. It is backward compatible with ASCII and is widely used on the internet due to its efficiency in encoding a vast array of characters while minimizing storage space for common characters.</p>
    <h2>URL</h2>
    <p>A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a web address that specifies the location of a resource on the internet. It consists of a protocol (like http or https), a domain name, and an optional path to a specific file or page.</p>
    <h2>Domain Name</h2>
    <p>A domain name is a human-readable address used to identify a specific website or server on the internet. It is part of a URL and is often associated with a particular organization or individual.</p>
    <h2>HTTP</h2>
    <p>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the protocol used for transmitting web pages and other content over the internet. It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted between a client (browser) and a server.</p>
    <h2>HTTPS</h2>
    <p>HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is a secure version of HTTP that uses encryption to protect data transmitted between a client and a server.</p>
    <h2>IP Address</h2>
    <p>An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique numerical identifier assigned to each device
    <h2>DNS</h2>
    <p>DNS (Domain Name System) is a system that translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses, allowing users to access websites using easy-to-remember names instead of numerical addresses.</p>
    <h2>W3C Recommendation</h2>
    <p>A W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) recommendation is a standard that has been formally approved by the W3C. These recommendations define the specifications for web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and XML.</p>
    <h2>Difference between XML, XHTML, HTML, HTML5</h2>
    <p>XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a flexible markup language used to store and transport data. It allows users to define their own tags and structure.</p>
    <p>XHTML (eXtensible Hypertext Markup Language) is a stricter version of HTML that follows the syntax rules of XML. It is designed to be more consistent and easier to parse.</p>
    <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It defines the structure and content of a webpage using predefined tags.</p>
    <p>HTML5 is the latest version of HTML that introduces new features and capabilities, such as support for multimedia, improved semantics, and enhanced APIs for web applications.</p>
